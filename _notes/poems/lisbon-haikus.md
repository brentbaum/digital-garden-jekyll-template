Dark eyes, lid relaxed
you hold my hands; I open.
no desire, just love.

I needed to come.
You can cry if you want to...
you're holding so much.

Shadows in corners
each one a threat-- I know now
they're just future friends

how's your night? *it's good*
I love you like a brother
*I don't cry much, thanks*
