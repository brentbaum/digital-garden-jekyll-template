The fabric is a gold-touched azul.
When you move past your disbelief
that a material like this could exist, walk
across the impossible room
and pick it up --
it slips your fingers, falling folded
perfectly imperfectly
on its alter.

You'll think of this day.
furrowed thought street crossing
stopped breathless by --
it slipped frictionless to fold and --
pebble crunching into pebble
under foot under
stride after stride --
you KNOW it's out there,
you saw its storied patterns
catch the light and --

You sense she was always already there.
Mountains aren't born;
the slow motion tectonic
collision was always already there too.

Perhaps she is a few years
into holding this aspect of the divine.
You first see it in an evaluative
head tilt:
the angle of her neck pulling
dark eyes up to reflect the light
inviting: disarm, join, play
  
You'll think of this day
The same feet that danced
her freedom now
step towards you.

The same hands that served
the others before you swing
by her side, brushing
the hip-wrapping fabric of restless nights.
You softly gasp your recognition
of the azul and gold.

Divinity itself chose
to wrap around her waist,
allowed itself to be thrown over
her proud shoulder,
hugged her form,
shimmering in dim light

You'll think of this day.
You'll hold your hand in love to
a stranger like she did you.
You'll look at others
with reflecting dark eyes
and see.

You'll dance your freedom,
breathing in and feeling
the soft fabric against your skin.

Her feet draw a serpentine
path as she closes
the gap.
Soft lips part.
In the breath before words
several proverbs on Beauty
snap from shuteye fantasy
to encyclopedic reality.

You'll meet her eyes
before glancing away --
you'll glance away
before meeting her eyes.
You'll allow herÂ 
to touch,
to slip that robe of hiding,
to wrap you
in your own love.
