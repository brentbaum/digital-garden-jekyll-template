Jack

The moon releases its grip on the ocean and the tide flows in.
He throws a change-up, loose fingers around seams doing without thinking.
His shoulder pulses dully, old injuries asserting the end but
he blinks back the discomfort and smiles across the sand. 
The game isn’t over yet.
  
The gloves and ball had been waiting.
A season had passed in silence away from their fading dreams.
They sat (post-words? pre-words?), talking around but not to, one facing ocean and one land.
He felt so drawn to look he had to look away;
he wanted to stare and smile but needed closed eyes to try.
Sky-painted water framed the forested island: a beautiful coming-together place.

They stood and walked to sandy mitts. Hands knew how to slip into leather, fingers
spun and held sandy red seams 
shoulders turned – arm down back around up and release.
The ball sailed with a simple thought: “fly,” old training translated the rest. 
  
Conversation unspun into relief, reaching past recent losses to old coaches & triumphs.
The ball flew between them in a series of measured tosses.
They both remembered. Muscles were stiff
so they took it slow. Rushed reps only lead to strains.

Now the slippery baseball – no longer encased with gritty sand –
leaves chaffed hand and finds his friend’s mitt with a pop. 
Smile, shoulder turn, back, release, pop; it’s back in his hand.
One last glory-days story, one last pop. 
Dull pain. He listens to his arm this time.
A window closes -- two county pitchers turned best friends 
with an ocean in between sit back on their towels.
The tide keeps moving in.
