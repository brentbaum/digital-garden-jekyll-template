Dear Dalton,

Thanks to a dear friend I took MDMA for the first time last night. I thought you'd be interested in hearing since you're always so curious and supportive! 

Sasha Chapin sets out a framework for MDMA consumption, [Two Solo Trips Totally ended My Self-Loathing](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/two-solo-mdma-trips-totally-ended). I set an intention to follow his method; first making a list of painful memories 

I set intentions to visit painful memories where I had messed up & to experience a new state of mind, investigating and storing it. Overall I was happy with the experience but wish I had a bit more on an empty stomach. We took the drug in a ceremony involving ginger tea and intention setting with a partner. I felt the effects after about an hour. While I waited I was able to get some wonderful metta going; half-adrenaline and half-all day intention setting pointed at this moment. After an hour of metta I got bored... and got in my head. Funny how subtle dissociation can be. I just tried to probe for feelings that weren't there but that I wanted to feel... and I felt myself tense up and close off.

I read a book. That calmed me down. The effects snuck up, gently building. My lips went numb first. It's a strange sensation! We have these muscular blubbery sense pockets in front of us all the time, and are constantly getting light sensations but ignoring them. I was quite focused on the book but the sensations were strong; I felt appreciation for my brain; always checking and probing behind the scenes for things my mind would never check.

I closed my eyes and felt. 200% lighter, calm, open. Somatically it's similar to mushroom comedowns but with no stimulant feeling to cause anxiety. I touched some memories of minor flubs from the day and felt none of the usual protectiveness. Time to go.

First up, a relatively safe memory: a bug I didn't catch taht lost my last company a $100/month customer. I was white-knuckling and sent an emotional apology to the CEO that got no reply. I stewed in it all weekend to show up to smiles on Monday; it didn't even register as a problem to the CEO. Sober, my chest tightened and my stomach turned. What did I feel now? Acknowledgment. Love for the CEO. A distanced view of the overwhelmed man who made a small mistake into a threat on his way of life. I gave him a hug.

I moved to another, deeper traumatic memory (the details I'll omit for privacy). I saw my emotion body react, tense up. Ok, no problem Lower valence experience next. 

An empty bar, talking with two of my more interesting + socially adept friends. They're talking about future plans. I was there, but had a wife at home with a strict covid socialization stance. They turn to me, excited, and ask if I'm in. I hesitate. I see them realize what I'm about to say. I say it anyway. The respect for me as an independent agent, a rational actor, fades form their eyes. Disappointment. If I cared about them then I'd come. They share an "i told you so" look and move on. I don't speak for the rest of the night."

Back in my bad, I see a loyal man who chose one shit sandwich instead of another. I give him a hug and forgive him. I feel light and open, like a carefully knotted shoelace from my throat to my sternum had loosened from don't-roll-an-ankle to weekend-slip-on. The attachment I had to that 2 year old memory dissolved. One month later, I feel no defensiveness. 

Time to go deeper.

First, I pause and run my left hand over my right. Bliss isn't the right word. Neither is pleasure. Security? Receptivity? I shifted my attention from left to right, from giving to recieving. I smile involuntarily. I'm loving me, caressing my own hand like I've only done for people I love. It's not sensual; it's nurturing, present, and loving. Left giving, right recieving. The frame shift is easy & not leaky. Fully giving, attention shift, fully recieving. Repeat. I'm crying now, physically recieving my own love. I whisper my care, and my voice is distant. I'm loving me with the normal intensity of love I feel for others. And I whisper back without reservation that I love me. Left hand, right hand, I let that voice in.

We held hands for a while, whisper turning to a deeper , tonally painting
